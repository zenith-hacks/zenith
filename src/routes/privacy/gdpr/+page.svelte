    data in compliance with the
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

  <h2>Data Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The Zenith Hacks Team is the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal data. If you have any

  <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Under the GDPR, we process your personal data based on your <strong>explicit consent</strong>, which you provide
    when you submit your email address via our sign-up notification form. We only process data that you have actively
    submitted and do not collect any data from third parties or by you visiting the website. Not submitting your email
    thus does not allow us to process any of your data.

    You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your
    personal data and ensure that it is fully deleted as soon as possible and within compliance of the GDPR.

    regulations </a>. We do not share your personal data with third parties unless required by law or with your explicit
    consent.

    to GDPR standards through appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or by working with
    GDPR-compliant service providers like Google.
