  <p>
    Zenith and the Zenith team (we, us) is committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of your personal data in
    compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This statement explains your additional rights as a
    data subject under the GDPR. Please read our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how we collect,
    store, and process personal data.

  <h2>Data Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The Zenith Hacks Team is the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal data. If you have any
    questions or concerns regarding the handling of your data, you may contact us at <a
      href="mailto:data@zenithhacks.org">data@zenithhacks.org</a
    >. We will respond to your inquiries as soon as possible. Please ensure that all emails adhere to our Code of

  <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Under the GDPR, we process your personal data based on your <strong>explicit consent</strong>, which you provide
    when you submit your email address via our sign-up notification form. We only process data that you have actively
    submitted and do not collect any data from third parties or by you visiting the website. Not submitting your email
    thus does not allow us to process any of your data.

    You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your
    personal data and ensure that it is fully deleted as soon as possible and within compliance of the GDPR.
